# Seafoam's Dyeable Blocks

Welcome to Seafoam's Dyeable Blocks, my first specialized mod under my own name, SeafoamWolf!  
Adding in a variety of dyeable blocks as well as items for crafting and actually dyeing said blocks, this mod is a pixel artist's dream!  
Enjoy creating wonderful pixel art and perfectly colored creations with Seafoam's Dyeable Blocks!
